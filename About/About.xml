Raiders aren't afraid to dip their toes, so why should you have to build a bridge to hold your traps? Just sink them to the bottom!

This will enable you to build traps on any terrain, including water. Anything with "trap" in its name will be affected, including traps from other mods.

BONUS: If you're using one of the selected fences mod, fences made out of wood or metal will get the same treatment! This should provide you with a complete solution for defenses on water. (I've excluded stone fences from this because I think it still makes sense for flooded terrain to not be able to support them.)
