Raiders aren't afraid to dip their toes, so why should you have to build a bridge to hold your traps? Just sink them to the bottom!

This will enable you to build traps on any terrain, including water. Anything with "trap" in its name will be affected, including traps from other mods.

BONUS: Fences now get the same treatment!
