# [JPT] Traps Go Wet
Build traps on water without bridges in RimWorld. 

[**>>> DOWNLOAD IT HERE <<<**](https://github.com/jptrrs/TrapsGoWet/releases/latest)

_Raiders aren't afraid to dip their toes, so why should you have to build a bridge to hold your traps? Just sink them to the bottom!_

This will enable you to build traps on any terrain, including water. Anything with "trap" in its name will be affected, including traps from other mods.

**Bonus:** Now, fences can also be built freely on water (but not gates). This includes vanilla fences and the ones from these mods:

</li>
</ul>
